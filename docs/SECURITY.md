# Houdinis Framework - Security Documentation

## Security Improvements and Vulnerability Fixes

This document outlines the comprehensive security improvements made to the Houdinis Framework.

### Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed

#### 1. Input Validation Vulnerabilities
- **Issue**: Raw `input()` calls without validation
- **Fix**: Implemented secure input handling with `getpass` for sensitive data
- **Files**: `quantum/backend.py`, `auxiliary/quantum_config_old.py`, `core/cli.py`
- **Security Impact**: Prevents credential exposure and input injection

#### 2. Command Injection Prevention
- **Issue**: Lack of command input validation
- **Fix**: Added regex-based command validation and sanitization
- **Files**: `core/cli.py`, `main.py`
- **Security Impact**: Prevents arbitrary command execution

#### 3. Path Traversal Protection
- **Issue**: Insufficient file path validation
- **Fix**: Implemented secure file operations with path validation
- **Files**: `security/secure_file_ops.py`
- **Security Impact**: Prevents unauthorized file access

#### 4. Database Security
- **Issue**: SQL injection vulnerabilities and insecure database operations
- **Fix**: Added parameterized queries, constraints, and secure permissions
- **Files**: `exploits/tls_sndl.py`
- **Security Impact**: Prevents SQL injection and unauthorized data access

#### 5. Network Security
- **Issue**: Insufficient input validation for network operations
- **Fix**: Added hostname/IP validation and secure socket handling
- **Files**: `exploits/ssh_quantum_attack.py`, `scanners/network_scanner.py`
- **Security Impact**: Prevents network-based attacks

### New Security Features

#### 1. Security Configuration Module
- **File**: `security/security_config.py`
- **Features**:
  - Centralized security validation
  - Input sanitization functions
  - Secure logging capabilities
  - Quantum vulnerability assessment
  - Token validation

#### 2. Secure File Operations
- **File**: `security/secure_file_ops.py`
- **Features**:
  - Path traversal protection
  - Secure file permissions (0o600)
  - Atomic file operations
  - Secure file deletion with overwriting
  - File size limits and validation

#### 3. Enhanced Logging
- **Features**:
  - Security event logging
  - Sensitive data hashing for logs
  - Secure log file permissions
  - Comprehensive audit trail

### Security Best Practices Implemented

#### 1. Input Validation
```python
# Before
token = input("Enter token: ")

# After
import getpass
token = getpass.getpass("Enter token (hidden): ")
if not SecurityConfig.validate_token(token):
    return False
```

#### 2. Secure File Handling
```python
# Before
with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
    f.write(data)

# After
secure_files = SecureFileOperations()
success = secure_files.secure_write_file(file_path, data, mode=0o600)
```

#### 3. Command Validation
```python
# Before
line = input(prompt)

# After
line = input(prompt).strip()
if not SecurityConfig.validate_command(line):
    print("[!] Invalid command")
    continue
```

### Security Configuration

#### File Permissions
- Database files: `0o600` (owner read/write only)
- Log files: `0o600` (owner read/write only)
- Configuration files: `0o600` (owner read/write only)
- Temporary directories: `0o700` (owner access only)

#### Input Limits
- Maximum input length: 1000 characters
- Maximum filename length: 255 characters
- Maximum command length: 500 characters
- Maximum file size: 100MB

#### Network Security
- Hostname validation with regex patterns
- Port validation (1-65535)
- Socket timeout enforcement (10 seconds)
- Response size limits

### Dependency Security

#### Updated Requirements
- `cryptography>=41.0.0` - Latest security patches
- `pycryptodome>=3.19.0` - Secure cryptographic operations
- `validators>=0.22.0` - Input validation
- `bleach>=6.0.0` - HTML sanitization

### Quantum Security Assessment

The framework now includes quantum vulnerability assessment for:
- RSA encryption (HIGH risk)
- DSA signatures (HIGH risk)
- ECDSA signatures (HIGH risk)
- DH key exchange (HIGH risk)
- AES-128 (MEDIUM risk)
- Hash functions (varies)

### Security Testing

#### Validation Tests
```bash
# Run security validation tests
python security/security_config.py

# Run secure file operations tests
python security/secure_file_ops.py
```

#### Security Checklist
- [ ] All user inputs validated
- [ ] File operations use secure paths
- [ ] Database queries parameterized
- [ ] Network inputs validated
- [ ] Sensitive data handled securely
- [ ] Proper error handling implemented
- [ ] Security events logged
- [ ] File permissions set correctly

### Responsible Disclosure

This framework is designed for:
- Educational purposes
- Authorized security testing
- Post-quantum cryptography research
- Vulnerability assessment (with permission)

### Legal Compliance

Users must:
- Only test systems they own or have permission to test
- Comply with applicable laws and regulations
- Use findings to improve security, not cause harm
- Report vulnerabilities responsibly

### Future Security Enhancements

1. **Multi-factor Authentication**: Implement MFA for sensitive operations
2. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting for network operations
3. **Encryption at Rest**: Encrypt stored session data
4. **Certificate Validation**: Enhanced SSL/TLS certificate validation
5. **Sandbox Mode**: Isolated execution environment for untrusted code
