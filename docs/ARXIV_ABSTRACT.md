# Houdinis Framework - arXiv Paper Abstract

## Title
Houdinis Framework: A Comprehensive Quantum Cryptography Exploitation Platform for Post-Quantum Security Assessment

## Abstract (1920 character limit for arXiv)

We present the Houdinis Framework, an open-source quantum cryptography exploitation platform designed for comprehensive security assessment of cryptographic implementations in the post-quantum era. The framework implements quantum algorithms including Shor's algorithm for integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems, and Grover's algorithm for symmetric key search, providing practical tools for evaluating quantum vulnerabilities in current cryptographic systems. Our platform supports multiple quantum computing backends including IBM Quantum, local simulators, and GPU-accelerated quantum circuit simulation. The framework addresses the critical need for proactive security assessment tools as quantum computing technology advances toward cryptographically relevant scales. We demonstrate the framework's capabilities through extensive testing scenarios covering RSA, ECC, AES, and post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, providing quantitative risk assessments and migration recommendations for organizations preparing for the quantum threat.
