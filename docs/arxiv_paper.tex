\begin{abstract}
We present the Houdinis Framework, an open-source quantum cryptography exploitation platform designed for comprehensive security assessment of cryptographic implementations in the post-quantum era. The framework implements quantum algorithms including Shor's algorithm for integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems, and Grover's algorithm for symmetric key search, providing practical tools for evaluating quantum vulnerabilities in current cryptographic systems. Our platform supports multiple quantum computing backends including IBM Quantum, local simulators, and GPU-accelerated quantum circuit simulation. The framework addresses the critical need for proactive security assessment tools as quantum computing technology advances toward cryptographically relevant scales. We demonstrate the framework's capabilities through extensive testing scenarios covering RSA, ECC, AES, and post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, providing quantitative risk assessments and migration recommendations for organizations preparing for the quantum threat.

\section{Introduction}

The advent of quantum computing poses an existential threat to current cryptographic infrastructure. Shor's algorithm \cite{shor1994algorithms} demonstrates polynomial-time quantum algorithms for integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems, effectively breaking RSA, ECC, and Diffie-Hellman cryptosystems that secure modern digital communications. Grover's algorithm \cite{grover1996fast} provides quadratic speedup for searching unsorted databases, reducing the effective security of symmetric cryptographic algorithms by half.

Current estimates suggest that cryptographically relevant quantum computers may emerge within the next 10-20 years \cite{nist2022quantum}, creating an urgent need for organizations to assess their quantum vulnerability and plan migration strategies. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has standardized post-quantum cryptographic algorithms \cite{nist2022pqc}, but the transition timeline and implementation challenges remain significant concerns.

This paper introduces the Houdinis Framework, a comprehensive platform for quantum cryptography exploitation and security assessment. Unlike existing quantum computing frameworks that focus on algorithm development or education, Houdinis specifically targets security professionals and researchers who need practical tools for quantum threat assessment and post-quantum migration planning.

\section{Background and Related Work}

\subsection{Quantum Cryptanalysis}

Quantum cryptanalysis leverages quantum mechanical principles to solve computational problems that are intractable for classical computers. The two most significant quantum algorithms for cryptography are:

\textbf{Shor's Algorithm:} Efficiently factors large integers and solves discrete logarithm problems in polynomial time $O((\log N)^3)$ on a quantum computer, compared to sub-exponential time for the best known classical algorithms \cite{shor1994algorithms}.

\textbf{Grover's Algorithm:} Provides quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems, reducing brute-force attack complexity from $O(2^n)$ to $O(2^{n/2})$ for n-bit keys \cite{grover1996fast}.

\subsection{Existing Quantum Computing Frameworks}

Several quantum computing frameworks exist for research and development:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Qiskit} \cite{qiskit2019}: IBM's open-source quantum computing framework
\item \textbf{Cirq} \cite{cirq2019}: Google's quantum computing framework
\item \textbf{PennyLane} \cite{pennylane2018}: Quantum machine learning framework
\item \textbf{Q\#} \cite{qsharp2017}: Microsoft's quantum development kit
\end{itemize}

However, these frameworks primarily target quantum algorithm development rather than security assessment applications.

\subsection{Security Assessment Tools}

Traditional penetration testing frameworks like Metasploit \cite{metasploit2003} provide comprehensive security assessment capabilities for classical vulnerabilities but lack quantum-specific modules. The Houdinis Framework fills this gap by providing quantum cryptanalysis tools in a familiar penetration testing environment.

\section{Framework Architecture}

\item \textbf{Extensibility}: Plugin architecture supporting additional quantum backends and algorithms
\item \textbf{Usability}: Command-line interface familiar to security professionals
\item \textbf{Scalability}: Support for both simulation and real quantum hardware
\item \textbf{Reproducibility}: Deterministic results with comprehensive logging
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Core Components}

The framework consists of several key components:

\subsubsection{Quantum Backend Abstraction Layer}
Provides unified interface to multiple quantum computing platforms:
\begin{itemize}
\item IBM Quantum Experience

\section{Implementation Details}

\subsection{Shor's Algorithm Implementation}

Our Shor's algorithm implementation follows the standard quantum period-finding approach \cite{shor1994algorithms}:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Quantum RSA Factorization}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\REQUIRE RSA modulus $N$, classical preprocessing
\ENSURE Factors $p, q$ such that $N = p \times q$
\STATE Choose random $a < N$ with $\gcd(a, N) = 1$
\STATE Initialize quantum registers: $|0\rangle^{\otimes n} \otimes |1\rangle$
\STATE Apply quantum Fourier transform to first register
\STATE Implement modular exponentiation: $|x\rangle|1\rangle \rightarrow |x\rangle|a^x \bmod N\rangle$
\STATE Apply inverse quantum Fourier transform
\STATE Measure first register to obtain period candidate
\STATE Use classical post-processing to extract factors
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The implementation includes optimizations for:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reduced qubit requirements using successive squaring
\item Error mitigation techniques for NISQ devices
\item Classical preprocessing for efficiency
\item Hybrid classical-quantum algorithms for practical deployment
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm Implementation}

The Grover search implementation targets symmetric key recovery:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Quantum Key Search}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\REQUIRE Ciphertext $C$, plaintext $P$, encryption function $E$
\ENSURE Key $k$ such that $E_k(P) = C$
\STATE Initialize superposition: $|s\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}|k\rangle$
\STATE Define oracle: $O|k\rangle = (-1)^{f(k)}|k\rangle$ where $f(k) = 1$ iff $E_k(P) = C$
\FOR{$i = 1$ to $\lceil\frac{\pi}{4}\sqrt{N}\rceil$}
    \STATE Apply oracle $O$
    \STATE Apply diffusion operator $D = 2|s\rangle\langle s| - I$
\ENDFOR
\STATE Measure to obtain key candidate
\STATE Verify key classically
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Backend Integration}

The framework supports multiple quantum backends through a unified interface:

\begin{verbatim}
class QuantumBackend:
    def execute_circuit(self, circuit, shots=1024):
        """Execute quantum circuit on backend"""
        pass
    
    def get_capabilities(self):
        """Return backend capabilities"""
        pass
    
    def estimate_runtime(self, circuit):
        """Estimate execution time"""
        pass
\end{verbatim}

This abstraction enables seamless switching between simulation and hardware execution, facilitating both research and practical deployment.
